# Predicting efficiency/effectiveness trade-offs for retrieval strategy selection
This repository includes codes and data regarding the paper "Predicting efficiency/effectiveness trade-offs for retrieval strategy selection".
In this work, we propose two classifiers in order to select a suitable retrieval strategy to maintain the trade-off between the cost and utility of  sparse vs. dense vs. hybrid retrievers for individual queries.

## Sparse vs Dense
